# How to Organize

0. **Do** follow existing organization **unless directed otherwise**.
1. Do **not** append " User Guide" to heading of "Tools & Apps" docs.[^1]
2. **Do** give heading a unique name e.g. "Potree Converter FAQ" not just "FAQ".


[^1]: If removing " User Guide" from a title of a page that is included in a live mega-doc, then add `{ #this-app-user-guide }` to maintain possible anchor link from external site, **unless we have a heading redirect solution ([possible solution](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/autorefs#backlinks))**.
