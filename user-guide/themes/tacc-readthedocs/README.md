# TACC Theme

The TACC theme is **not** supported for local development via Python.

To use the TACC theme, locally develop via Docker.

This folder exists to avoid the error:

```
ERROR - Config value 'theme': The path set in custom_dir
        ('.../user-guide/themes/tacc-readthedocs') does not exist.
```
