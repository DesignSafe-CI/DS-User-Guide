# Getting Started

## User Account Registration

Any natural hazards researcher or practitioner that wants an environment to store, analyze, curate, publish, and discover data with a community of peers may register for an account. Detailed account registration instructions can be found [here](https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/basics/accounts/).

1. [**Request a user account**](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/account/register/)
2. You will be redirected to the TACC account registration page.
    1. It's possible that your email provider will either block or mark as spam/junk an email TACC sends with a link to confirm your email address after you submit the registration form. If so, send email to helpATdesignsafe-ci.org letting us know you did not receive the email.
3. You will first be asked to verify your identity via a 3rd party provider.
4. On the account registration form we highly recommend you provide the email address provided by your Institution or Company.
5. Once you have an account, set up [multi-factor authentication](https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/basics/mfa/).
6. You will then be able to [**log in to DesignSafe**](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/).

**Please note**: A DesignSafe account is a TACC user account, so you will sometimes see emails from TACC and URLs that take you to the TACC domain `tacc.utexas.edu`.

## Initial Onboarding

When you are ready to begin uploading your own data to the Data Depot or want to begin using some of the Tools & Apps, you will want to initiate the onboarding process. The initial onboarding provides you with [private areas for your data](/user-guide/managingdata/datadepot/) and access to Tools & Apps that are hosted on our Virtual Machines such as [JupyterHub](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/use-designsafe/tools-applications/analysis/jupyter/) or [Interactive VM for OpenSees](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/use-designsafe/tools-applications/simulation/opensees/). Access to HPC-enabled applications requires [an additional step](#requestallocations).

There are 2 ways to invoke the onboarding:

1. Navigate to the Data Depot.
2. Navigate to Tools & Apps, then into any of the apps and find one that uses HPC such as OpenSeesMP and click Get Started.

You will be redirected to the Onboarding Setup page, and you will then want to click Request Access.

## Request Allocations to Use the HPC-enabled Tools & Apps { #requestallocations }

DesignSafe provides many HPC-enabled Tools & Apps that require an allocation of computing time. Upon navigating to one of these, such as [OpenSeesMP](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/use-designsafe/tools-applications/simulation/opensees/) and clicking on "Get Started" you will see a banner informing you to submit a ticket requesting an allocation if you don't already have one.
