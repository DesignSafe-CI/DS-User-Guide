## Initial Onboarding

When you are ready to begin uploading your own data to the Data Depot or want to begin using some of the Tools & Apps, you will want to initiate the onboarding process. The initial onboarding provides you with [private areas for your data](/user-guide/managingdata/datadepot/) and access to Tools & Apps that are hosted on our Virtual Machines such as [JupyterHub](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/use-designsafe/tools-applications/analysis/jupyter/). Access to HPC-enabled applications requires [an additional step](#requestallocations).

There are 2 ways to invoke the onboarding:

1. Navigate to the [Data Depot](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/data/browser/).
2. Navigate to [Tools & Apps](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/use-designsafe/tools-applications/), then into any of the apps and find one that uses HPC (such as OpenSeesMP) and click Get Started.

You will be redirected to the Onboarding Setup page, and you will then want to click **Request Access**. While rare, we occasionally will reach out to you requesting additional information prior to approving onboarding. Approvals typically are processed within 1 business day.

If your usage requires HPC resources, you might need to [Request Allocations](/user-guide/request-allocations/).
