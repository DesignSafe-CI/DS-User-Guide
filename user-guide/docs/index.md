# Getting Started

## 1. Account Creation

{% include-markdown 'account-register--content.md' %}

## 2. Initial Onboarding

When you are ready to begin uploading your own data to the Data Depot or want to begin using some of the Tools & Apps, you will want to initiate the onboarding process. The initial onboarding provides you with [private areas for your data](/user-guide/managingdata/datadepot/) and access to Tools & Apps that are hosted on our Virtual Machines such as [JupyterHub](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/use-designsafe/tools-applications/analysis/jupyter/) or [Interactive VM for OpenSees](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/use-designsafe/tools-applications/simulation/opensees/). Access to HPC-enabled applications requires [an additional step](#requestallocations).

There are 2 ways to invoke the onboarding:

1. Navigate to the [Data Depot](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/data/browser/).
2. Navigate to [Tools & Apps](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/use-designsafe/tools-applications/), then into any of the apps and find one that uses HPC (such as OpenSeesMP) and click Get Started.

You will be redirected to the Onboarding Setup page, and you will then want to click **Request Access**. While rare, we occasionally will reach out to you requesting additional information prior to approving onboarding. Approvals typically are processed within 1 business day.

## Request Allocations { #requestallocations }

DesignSafe provides many HPC-enabled Tools & Apps that require an allocation of computing time. Upon navigating to one of these (such as [OpenSeesMP](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/use-designsafe/tools-applications/simulation/opensees/)) and clicking on "Get Started", you will see a banner informing you to submit a ticket requesting an allocation if you don't already have one. Please provide the following information in your allocation request:

1. Provide a paragraph describing your research topic, including which of the [DesignSafe Tools & Apps](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/use-designsafe/tools-applications/) you anticipate using.
2. If you are faculty, please provide a link to your web page.
3. If you are not faculty, please provide the name of your academic advisor and a link to their web page.
4. If you are a practitioner or other user, please provide a link to your current information such as company web page or LinkedIn.
