# Account Help

## Password Reset

To **reset your password**, go to [https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/forgot_password](https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/forgot_password){target="_blank"}, enter your username or email address that is associated with your user account, and you will receive an email with a password reset link.

## Account Reactivation

If you receive an error message when logging in, and you are confident that you have entered the correct password for your account, then it is likely that you need to **Reactivate Account** as a result of your account being Deactivated due to more than 120 days having passed since you last logged in. You will first need to [request an activation link](https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/activate){target="_blank"}. You will then receive an email at the email address associated with your user account that has instructions for account reactivation. It's possible that you won't find this email in your inbox due to your email provider either blocking or marking as spam/junk. If so, send email to helpATdesignsafe-ci.org letting us know you did not receive the email.

Once your account returns to an Active state, you will also need to [pair your MFA App again](https://tacc.utexas.edu/portal/account){target="_blank"}. Note that it is possible your MFA shows as still being paired, and you will need to unpair and then pair again.

## Profile Update

There are multiple reasons you would either want to or be required to [update your profile](https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/profile). Some of the most common include:
1. Your email address changes.
2. Your Institution/Company/Organization changes.
3. Your citizenship changes.
4. You receive an email from TACC requiring an annual profile update.
It's possible the policies regarding email domains and Institutions have changed since the last time you either created your account or updated your profile, so you may want to review the [User Account Registration guide](https://designsafe-ci.org/user-guide/#user-account-registration) for the current guidance.
