# Managing Your Data

## Data Management Plan

You can customize our [DesignSafe **Data Management Plan Guide** Template](./docs/DesignSafe_Data_Management_Plan_Guidance.docx) for the specific details of your research project that will use the NHERI DesignSafe cyberinfrastructure (CI). There is guidance on the five main DMP areas required by the National Science Foundation (NSF), along with information about the DesignSafe CI functionalities that can support your data management needs.

## Data Curation Resources

Our [Data Curation Resources](/user-guide/data-depot/curate-and-publish) provide guidance on the organization, description, quality control, preservation, accessibility, and ease of reuse of data, to make your data publication [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and ensure that it will be useful for generations to come.
