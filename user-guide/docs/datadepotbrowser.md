# Data Depot's Browser-Based Data Transfer Guide

---
The Data Depot's browser interface allows you to conveniently upload and download small quantities of data (&lt; 100 MB, &lt; 25 files, &lt; 2 folders) as well as move and copy data between directories.

## Upload

To upload a small amount of data through your browser **login to DesignSafe** and **go to My Data**.

**Open the DesignSafe directory where you wish to uploaded your data.** Here we upload to "an_example_upload_directory".

Select **+ Add** then **File Upload: max 100 MB**.

Select **Browse...** at the top to select the files you wish to upload. Press **Begin upload** to initiate the transfer.

Once the transfer is complete the Upload files window will close and you will see your files in your DesignSafe directory.

**Note, if the files are not immediately visible refresh the page.**

If you wish to upload a folder, follow the same procedure as above except select **Folder upload: max 25 files**. However, be sure that the folder you wish to upload is small than 100 MB and contains fewer than 25 files. If the folder you wish to upload exceeds these limits please use one of the large data transfer methods listed in the <a href="/rw/user-guides/data-transfer-guide/">Data Transfer Guide</a> rather than the web interface.

## Download

To download a file from DesignSafe to your local desktop/laptop **select the file** you wish to download and press **Download**.

**Note depending on how you have configured your browser, it will either download the file directly to your default downloads directory or will prompt you to save the file in a location of your choice.**
