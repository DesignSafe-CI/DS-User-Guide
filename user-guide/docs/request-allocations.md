# Request Allocations { #requestallocations }

DesignSafe provides many HPC-enabled Tools & Apps that require an allocation of computing time. Upon navigating to one of these (such as [OpenSeesMP](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/use-designsafe/tools-applications/simulation/opensees/)) and clicking on "Get Started", you will see a banner informing you to submit a ticket requesting an allocation if you don't already have one. Please provide the following information in your allocation request:

1. Provide a paragraph describing your research topic, including which of the [DesignSafe Tools & Apps](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/use-designsafe/tools-applications/) you anticipate using.
2. If you are faculty, please provide a link to your web page.
3. If you are not faculty, please provide the name of your academic advisor and a link to their web page.
4. If you are a practitioner or other user, please provide a link to your current information such as company web page or LinkedIn.
