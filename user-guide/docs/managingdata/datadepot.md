In the Data Depot users can browse, upload, download, share, curate and publish data. It hosts both private and published data associated with a research project and can be used as a working area for any of the users’ own data and work in progress, as well as for curating and publishing datasets. Scientific applications in [Tools &  Applications] (https://www.designsafe-ci.org/use-designsafe/tools-applications/) can access files in the Data Depot, enabling data analysis directly in the DesignSafe portal that minimizes the need to transfer data to your laptop. In turn, users can curate  the data and publish it in the [Data Depot Repository](https://designsafe-ci.org/data/browser/public/designsafe.storage.published)  The Data Depot has the following services listed at the right hand side of the interface:

* **My Data**: Private directory for your data.
* **HPC Work**: Work directory on TACC HPC machines for use with Jupyter.
* **My Projects**: Data to be curated and published must be in this directory. Users can control access and share this data with other team members with whom they are working on a project.
* **Box.com**: Access Box for copying files to DesignSafe.
* **Dropbox.com**: Access Dropbox for copying files to DesignSafe.
* **Published**: Curated datasets with DOI's preserved and made available in the Data Depot Repository.
* **Published (NEES)**: Curated and published datasets supported through the NEES program that ran from 1999 to 2015.
* **Community Data**: Non-curated user-contributed data.

The Data Depot provides a user interface with a familiar desktop metaphor for manipulating files. The UI for a typical Data Depot window is shown in Figure 1 above. On the left is your directory tree (My Data, etc), and on the right are the files and folders within the currently selected directory. Folders can be navigated simply by clicking on the name of the folders. Clicking on the name of a file will pop up a preview of the file. 

The Data Depot is searchable using the "Find in <DirectoryName>" search box  (The global website search box "Search DesignSafe" is above and to the right). 

Alongside the search, buttons are available for a number of file and folder actions. The Rename, Move, Copy, Download, etc. actions all behave as one would expect.

Click on the blue "+Add" button above the list of directories to create a New Folder, a New Project in My Projects, to do a File Upload or a Folder upload or for Bulk Data Transfer instructions. Note that only Chrome supports browser-based Folder uploads.

A number of data transfer methods are supported for uploading and downloading files. The [Data Transfer Guide](../#data-transfer-guides) provides details regarding the various methods and recommendations based on the quantity and size of your files.

### Data Sharing, Collaboration, Curation & Publication { #sharing }

My Projects is the simplest way to share data with your collaborators and to curate and ultimately publish your data and receive a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Any team member in a project has both read and write access to the entire contents of the project. The Data Curation & Publication User Guide provides instructions for creating projects, managing team members, curating and publishing your data.
