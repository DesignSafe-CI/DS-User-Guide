# JupyterHub's Browser-Based Data Transfer Guide

The DesignSafe JupyterHub provides a convenient way to upload and download small amounts of data ( &lt; 100 MB, &lt; 25 files).

## To Upload a File Through Jupyter

Launch Jupyter by logging into DesignSafe and going to **Workspace** &gt; **Tools &amp; Applications** &gt; **Analysis** &gt; **Jupyter** &gt; **Select Jupyter from dropdown**.

When your session has launched you will see a directory structure similar to that shown below.

Select **MyData**.
