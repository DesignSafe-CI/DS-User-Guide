# Data Preservation

Data preservation encompasses diverse activities carried out by all the stakeholders involved in the lifecycle of data, from data management planning to data curation, publication and long-term archiving. Once data is submitted to the Data Depot Repository (DDR,) we have functionalities and <a href="https://www.designsafe-ci.org/rw/user-guides/" target="_blank">Guidance </a>in place to address the long-term preservation of the submitted data.

The DDR has been operational since 2016 and is currently supported by the NSF from October 1st, 2020 through September 30, 2025. During this award period, the DDR will continue to preserve the natural hazards research data published since its inception, as well as supporting preservation of and access to legacy data and the accompanying metadata from the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES), a NHERI predecessor, dating from 2005. The legacy data comprising 33 TB, 5.1 million files,2 and their metadata was transferred to DesignSafe in 2016 as part of the conditions of the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14605/nsf14605.htm">original grant</a>. See NEES data <a href="https://www.designsafe-ci.org/data/browser/public-legacy/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Data in the  (DDR) is preserved according to state-of-the art digital library standards and best practices. DesignSafe is implemented within the reliable, secure, and scalable storage infrastructure at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), with 20 years of experience and innovation in High Performance Computing. TACC is currently over 20 years old, and TACC and its predecessors have operated a digital data archive continuously since 1986 – currently implemented in the <a href="https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/corral" target="_blank">Corral</a> Data Management system and the <a href="https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/ranch" target="_blank">Ranch</a> tape archive system, with capacity of approximately half an exabyte. Corral and Ranch hold the data for DesignSafe and hundreds of other research data collections.

Within TACC’s storage infrastructure a <a href="https://duraspace.org/fedora/." target="_blank">Fedora</a> repository, considered a standard for digital libraries, manages the preservation of the published data. Through its functionalities, Fedora assures the authenticity and integrity of the digital objects, manages versioning, identifies file formats, records preservation events as metadata, maintains RDF metadata in accordance to standard schemas, conducts audits, and maintains the relationships between data and metadata for each published research project and its corresponding datasets. Each published dataset in DesignSafe has a Digital Object Identifier, whose maintenance we understand as a firm commitment to data persistence.

While at the moment DDR is committed to preserve data in the format in which it is submitted, we procure the necessary authorizations from users to conduct further preservation actions as well as to transfer the data to other organizations if applicable. These permissions are granted through our <a href="https://www.designsafe-ci.org/rw/user-guides/curating-publishing-projects/policies/publication/" target="_blank">Data Publication Agreement</a>, which authors acknowledge and have the choice to agree to at the end of the publication workflow and prior to receiving a DOI for their dataset.

Data sustainability is a continuous effort that DDR accomplishes along with the rest of the NHERI partners. In the natural hazards space, data is central to new advances, which is evidenced by the data reuse record of our community and the following initiatives:

<u>Continuity of Access</u>

As part of the requirements of the current award we have a contingency pan in place to transfer all the DDR data, metadata and corresponding DOIs to a new awardee (should one be selected) without interruption of services and access to data. Fedora has <a href="https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/FEDORA50/Import+and+Export+Tools">export capabilities </a>for transfer of data and metadata to another repository in a complete and validated fashion. The  portability plan is confirmed and updated in the Operations Project Execution Plan that we present anually to the NSF. 

In the  case in which the NSF and/or the other stakeholders involved in this community decide not to continue the NHERI program or a subsequent data repository, we will continue to preserve the published data  and provide access to it through TACC, DesignSafe’s host at the University of Texas at Austin. TACC has formally committed to preserving the data with landing pages and corresponding DOIs indefinitely. TACC has on permanent staff a User Services team as well as curators that will attend users’ requests /and help tickets related to the data. Because TACC is constantly updating its high-performance storage resources and security mechanisms, data will be preserved at the same  preservation level that is currently available. Considering that DOIs are supported through the University of Texas Libraries and that the web services and the data reside within TACC’s managed resources, access to data will not be interrupted. Fedora is now part of TACC’s software suite and we will continue its maintenance as our preservation repository. Like with all systems at TACC, we will revisit its versioning and continuity and make decisions based on state-of-the-art practices. Should funding constraints ever make this no longer possible, TACC will continue to keep an archive copy on Ranch (with landing pages on online storage) for as long as TACC remains a viable entity.
