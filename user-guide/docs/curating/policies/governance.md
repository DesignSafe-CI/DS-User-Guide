# Governance

Policies for the DDR are driven by the Natural Hazards (NH) scientific community and informed by best practices in library and information sciences. The DDR operates under the leadership of the DesignSafe Management Team (DSMT), who establishes and updates policies, evaluates and recommends best practices, oversees its technical development, and prioritizes activities. The broad organizational structure under which the DDR operates is <a href="https://www.designsafe-ci.org/about/designsafe/">here</a>.

## [Repository Team](#repositoryteam) { #repositoryteam }

An interdisciplinary repository team (RT) carries out ongoing design, development and day-to-day operations, gathering requirements and discussing solutions through formal monthly and bi-weekly meetings with the NHERI community and maintaining regular communications with members of the network, including monthly meetings with the<a href="https://www.designsafe-ci.org/facilities/experimental/"> Experimental Facilities</a>, <a href="https://rapid.designsafe-ci.org/">RAPID</a>, and <a href="https://rapid.designsafe-ci.org/">CONVERGE</a> staff. Based on these fluid communications, the RT designs functionalities, researches and develops best-practices, and implements agreed-upon solutions. The figure below shows the current formation of the RT, including their expertise.

Formal mechanisms are in place for external evaluators to gather feedback and conduct structured assessments, in the form of usability studies and yearly user surveys, to ensure that the repository is meeting the communityâ€™s expectations and needs. To track development the DDR curator meets every other week with the DesignSafe PI and with the head of the development team. All DDR activities are reported to the National Science Foundation on a quarterly and annual basis in terms of quantitative and qualitative progress.

## [Community Norms for DDR](#norms) { #norms }

Within the broader conditions of use for DesignSafe we have established a set of Community Norms specific for DDR which have to be agreed upon at the point of registering an account on the platform. These norms, highlighting our existing policies, are the following:

Users who either publish and use data in DDR must abide by both the <a href="https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-usage-policy">TACC Acceptable Use Policy</a> and the <a href="https://www.designsafe-ci.org/account/terms-conditions/">DesignSafe Terms of Use</a>.
