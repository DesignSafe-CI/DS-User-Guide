# What is Data Curation?

Data curation involves the organization, description, quality control, preservation, accessibility, and ease of reuse of data, with the goal of making your data publication [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and assuring that it will be useful for generations to come.

Step-by-step data curation instructions can be found in [How to Curate Data?](/user-guide/curating/guides.md), and we strongly recommend following the onboarding instructions in the My Project curation and publication interface. We are available for additional help during our [Virtual Office Hours](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/facilities/virtual-office-hours/) and via [help tickets](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/help/submit-ticket/). The [DDR Policies](/user-guide/curating/policies/) communicate requirements for managing and publishing data. General curation best practices exist for [Curation Quality](/user-guide/curating/bestpractices/#curation-quality) and [Curating Various Types of Research Data](/user-guide/curating/bestpractices/#curating-various-types-of-research-data).
