### 1. Add a Project

<img src="../../imgs/guide-fieldresearch-1a.jpg">
    
You can start a project at the very beginning of its lifespan, upload and curate data incrementally, then publish sets of data at your convenience.

To add a new project, click <strong>+ Add</strong>, then select <strong>New Project</strong>.

<img src="../../imgs/guide-fieldresearch-1b.png">
    
In the Add New Project window, fill in a project title and list the principal investigator (PI) and project members.

PIs and project members have the same level of access to the project, but the PI will be listed separately in the metadata. Additional PIs will be listed as Co-PIs. 

You can edit all these fields later.

Once finished, click <strong>+</strong> <strong>Add Project</strong> and you will be taken to your new project in the My Projects tab.

To learn how to move files into your project, visit our <a href="/rw/user-guides/getting-started/">Getting Started</a> guide.

### 2. Add a Mission

To begin curation, click on the <strong>Curation Directory</strong> and select <strong>Field Research</strong> as your Project Type.

Please, read the overview, it has information that will clarify and guide you through the curation process.

Fill out required fields in the <strong>Edit Project </strong>window. Without this information your project will not be published. Click <strong>Update Project, </strong>then click <strong>Add Missions</strong>.

A mission is a group of data collections that are associated with a common goal or time. Some researchers may also refer to this as Time or Wave.

Adding a mission involves filling out high-level information (e.g. title, date, geolocation and description) about the files you will be publishing. 

Each mission will receive a unique DOI. Add multiple missions if any of this high-level information changes or you want multiple DOIs. Do not add another mission if you are surveying the same location with different instruments and this information stays the same. Instead, you can add multiple collections to one mission.

Fill out the required and optional fields using the advice given to create concise and understandable descriptions. You can order the authors later when it is time to publish.

Click <strong>+</strong> <strong>Add Mission</strong> when you are done and it will appear below in your inventory.

You can edit a mission from the mission inventory.

### 3. Add Collections

Click <strong>Add Collections</strong> to begin.

Collections group files together based on a shared purpose in a mission. There are three different collection types in field research data model:

<u>Research Planning Collection:</u>

A group of files related to planning and logistics, study design and administration, design, Institutional Review Board (IRB) procedures, or permits.

<u>Engineering/Geosciences Collection:</u> 

A group of related data and associated materials from the engineering/geosciences domain.

<u>Social Sciences Collection:</u> 

A group of related data and associated materials from the social sciences domain.

When defining a collection, there are several information that are required to be filled for curation and publication purposes such as collection title, observation type, data of collection, data collector, collection site location, the instrument and a summarized description.

After filling out the fields, click <strong>+ Add Collection</strong> and it will appear below in your collection inventory. If you make any mistakes, expand the category and click <strong>Edit</strong>.

### 4. Relate Data

Click <strong>Relate Data</strong> to begin.

Relating Data allows you to relate collections to missions, which determines the organization of your dataset. You can also establish the order of your collections.

When published, this diagram will help others understand the structure of your Field Research. Now you are ready to assign files to your collections.

### 5. Assign Collections to Files

As you create collections, they will appear in a dropdown next to each file. This allows you select collections for any file in your project and group them under each collection. Click <strong>Save</strong> to confirm the collection.

If you assigned a collection to a folder, then all files within that folder will belong to the collection of the folder. 

A file can belong to one or more collections.

Click <strong>Remove</strong> if you make any mistakes.

### 6. Tag Files

After putting files in collections, dropdowns will appear to allow you to tag/describe unique files. 

The natural hazards community has contributed to creating these agreed upon terms.

These tags are optional, but recommended.

If you do not see a file tag that fits, you can select <strong>Other</strong> and write in your own descriptive tag.

### 7. Publication Preview

All of the curation work is done in the Curation Directory. The Publication Preview lets you examine the layout of your publication so you can visualize/verify how your work will appear once published.

Look through the Publication Preview early and often to make changes or catch mistakes. If you are working collaboratively with others, this is a good way to proofread changes.

### 8. Prepare to Publish

When you are satisfied with how your work is curated and wish to publish it, select Prepare to Publish in the Publication Preview. 

There are 6 stages in the publication process:

In <strong>Selection</strong>, select which mission you want to publish. At this time, you can only publish one mission at a time.

In <strong>Proofread Project</strong>,<strong> Missions</strong>,<strong> &amp; Collections</strong>, take time to read all the descriptions and metadata you have entered. You will not be able to make changes after publishing.

In <strong>Order Authors</strong>, order the authors of the mission and preview how your citation will appear.
