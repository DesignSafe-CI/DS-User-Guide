# Curation &amp; Publication User Guide

Below are step-by-step guides on how to create projects in the Data Depot, and curate and publish work/data across DesignSafe. We offer the following project types when publishing: Experimental, Simulation, Hybrid Simulation, Field Research, and Other. More information on Data Depot policies, project types, and curation/publication can be found at:

## [1. Add a Project](#step1) { #step1 }
    
You can start a project at the very beginning of its lifespan, upload and curate data incrementally, then publish sets of data at your convenience.

To add a new project, click <strong>+ Add</strong>, then select <strong>New Project</strong>.

<img src="../../imgs/guide-allguides-1a.jpg">
    
In the Add New Project window, fill in a project title and list the principal investigator (PI) and project members.

<img src="../../imgs/guide-allguides-1b.png">

PIs and project members have the same level of access to the project, but the PI will be listed separately in the metadata. Additional PIs will be listed as Co-PIs. 

You can edit all these fields later if you make any mistakes.

Once finished, click <strong>+</strong> <strong>Add Project</strong> and you will be taken to your new project in the My Projects tab.

To learn how to move files into your project, visit our <a href="/rw/user-guides/getting-started/">Getting Started</a> guide.

## [2. Add an Experiment](#step2) { #step2 }

To begin curation and add an experiment, click on the <strong>Curation Directory</strong> and select <strong>Experimental</strong> as your Project Type.

<img src="../../imgs/guide-experimental-2a.png">

Go through the overview and fill out additional required fields in the <strong>Edit Project</strong> window, click <strong>Update Project, </strong>then click <strong>Add Experiments</strong>.

    
Adding an experiment involves filling out high level information about the files you will be publishing. Each experiment will receive its own DOI. Add multiple experiments if any of this information changes or you want multiple DOIs. Do not add another experiment if you are testing multiple models and this information stays the same. Instead, you can add multiple models to one experiment.

<img src="../../imgs/guide-experimental-2b.png">

Fill out the required and optional fields using the advice given to create concise and understandable descriptions. 

Also, assign authorship from a list of the project members and PIs. You can order the authors later when it is time to publish.

Click <strong>+</strong> <strong>Add Experiment</strong> when you are done and it will appear below in your inventory.

You can edit an experiment from the inventory.

## [3. Add Categories](#step3) { #step3 }

    
Click <strong>Add Categories</strong> to begin.

<img src="../../imgs/guide-experimental-3.png">

Categories group files together based on a shared purpose in an experiment. Be sure and read the definitions of each category to understand what files belong to each.

<span style="color: #145ec2;"><strong>Model Configuration</strong></span> Files describing the design and layout of what is being tested (some call this a specimen).

<strong><span style="color: #3b9b92;">Sensor Information</span></strong> Files about the sensor instrumentation used in a model configuration to conduct one or more event.

<span style="color: #ac8804;"><strong>Event</strong></span> Files from unique occurrences during which data are generated.

<strong><span style="color: #4cb8db;">Analysis</span></strong> Tables, graphs, visualizations, Jupyter Notebooks, or other representations of the results.

<strong>Report</strong> Written accounts made to convey information about an entire project or experiment.

After filling out the fields, click <strong>+ Add Category</strong> and it will appear below in your inventory. If you make any mistakes, expand the category and click <strong>Edit</strong>.

---
## [4. Relate Data](#step4) { #step4 }

Click <strong>Relate Data</strong> to begin.

<img src="../../imgs/guide-experimental-4.png">

Relating Data allows you to relate categories to each other and to an experiment, which determines the layout and order of categories in your publication. You can reorder the categories if needed.

When published, this diagram will help others understand the structure of your experiment at a glance.

---
## [5. Assign Categories to Files](#step5) { #step5 }


<img src="../../imgs/guide-experimental-5a.png">
    
As you create categories, they will appear in a dropdown by each file. This allows you to group files in each category. Click <strong>Save</strong> to confirm the category.

If you categorize a folder, then all files within that folder will belong to the category of the folder. <br>
<br>
A file can belong to one or more categories.

Click <strong>Remove</strong> if you make any mistakes.

## [6. Tag Files](#step6) { #step6 }

<img src="../../imgs/guide-experimental-6.png">

After putting files in categories, dropdowns will appear to allow you to tag specific files. 

The natural hazards community has contributed to creating these agreed upon terms.

These tags are optional, but recommended.

If you do not see a file tag that fits, you can select <strong>Other</strong> and write in your own.

---
## [7. Publication Preview](#step7) { #step7 }

<img src="../../imgs/guide-experimental-7a.png">
    
All of the curation work is done in the Curation Directory, while the Publication Preview lets you examine the layout of your publication to give you a peace of mind about how your work will appear to other researchers once published.

<img src="../../imgs/guide-experimental-7b.png">
    
Look through the Publication Preview early and often to catch any mistakes. If you are working collaboratively with others, this is a good way to proofread changes they make.

---
## [8. Prepare to Publish](#step8) { #step8 }

When you are satisfied with how your work is curated and wish to publish it, select Prepare to Publish in the Publication Preview. 

<img src="../../imgs/guide-experimental-8.png">
    
There are 6 stages in the publication process: <br>
Selection, Proofread Project, Proofread Experiment, Proofread Categories, Order Authors, and Licenses

In <strong>Selection</strong>, select which experiment you want to publish. You can only publish one at a time.

In <strong>Proofread Project</strong>,<strong> Experiment</strong>,<strong> &amp; Categories</strong>, take time to proofread all the descriptions and metadata you have entered. You cannot make changes after publishing.

In <strong>Order Authors</strong>, order the authors of the experiment and preview how your citation will appear.

In <strong>Licenses</strong>, select one or more licenses that best fit your data.

Finally, click <strong>Request DOI &amp; Publish</strong> and agree to the agreement to publish your work.
