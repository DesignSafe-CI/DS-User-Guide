# What is Data Curation?

Data curation involves the organization, description, quality control, preservation, accessibility, and ease of reuse of data, with the goal of making your data publication FAIR and assuring that it will be useful for generations to come.

We strongly recommend following the onboarding instructions in the My Project curation and publication interface. We are available for additional help during our [Virtual Office Hours](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/facilities/virtual-office-hours/) and via [help tickets](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/help/submit-ticket/). The [DDR Policies](/user-guide/data-depot/policies/) communicate requirements for managing and publishing data. General curation best practices exist for [Curation Quality](/user-guide/data-depot/best-practices/#curation-quality) and [Curating Various Types of Research Data](/user-guide/data-depot/best-practices/#curating-various-types-of-research-data).
