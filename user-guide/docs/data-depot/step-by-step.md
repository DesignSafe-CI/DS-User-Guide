## What is Data Curation?

Data curation involves the organization, description, quality control, preservation, accessibility, and ease of reuse of data, with the goal of making your data publication [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and ensuring that it will be useful for generations to come.

Step by step data curation instructions can be found in the [Steps to Curate and Publish your Datasets](/user-guide/data-depot/best-practices/#curating-various-types-of-research-data), and we strongly recommend  following the onboarding instructions in the My Project curation and publication interface. We are available for additional help during our [virtual Office Hours](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/facilities/virtual-office-hours/) and via [help tickets](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/help/submit-ticket/). The [DDR Policies](/user-guide/data-depot/policies/) communicate requirements for managing and publishing data and general curation best practices are highlighted below.
