## What is Data Curation?

Data curation involves the organization, description, quality control, preservation, accessibility, and ease of reuse of data, with the goal of making your data publication [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and ensuring that it will be useful for generations to come.

Step by step data curation instructions can be found in the [Steps to Curate and Publish your Datasets](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/user-guide/curating/guides/), and we strongly recommend  following the onboarding instructions in the My Project curation and publication interface. [Virtual Office Hours](https://github.com/DesignSafe-CI/DS-User-Guide/blob/mesteva-datadepotrepo-updates/user-guide/docs/curating/bestpractices.md#nheri-virtual-office-hours) twice a week and [Help tickets](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/help/submit-ticket/) are available for additional help. The [DDR Policies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1KSeyezPCwjDIHBSP2EEwauWFUKy_RiVVqKVepUAUA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.jcgpuqc6jitr) communicate requirements for managing and publishing data and general curation best practices are highlighted below.
