## Resources for Protected Data

The following de-identification resources for processing protected data. The NISTIR 8053 publication [De-Identification of Personal Information](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2015/NIST.IR.8053.pdf) provides all the definitions and approaches to reduce privacy risk and enable research. Another [NIST resource](https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/privacy-engineering/collaboration-space/focus-areas/de-id) including de-identification tools. John Hopkins Libraries Data Services [Applications to Assist in De-identification of Human Subjects Research Data](https://dataservices.library.jhu.edu/resources/applications-to-assist-in-de-identification-of-human-subjects-research-data/)

CONVERGE has a series of [check sheets](https://converge.colorado.edu/resources/check-sheets/ethical-considerations/) that outline how researchers should manage data that could contain sensitive information; these check sheets have also been published in [the DDR](http://doi.org/10.17603/ds2-7r74-1021)

In addition, we suggest that users look into the [Data Curation Primers](https://datacurationnetwork.org/outputs/data-curation-primers/) from the Data Curation Network, which are "peer-reviewed, living documents that detail a specific subject, disciplinary area or curation task, and that can be used as a guidelines to curate research data. The primers include curation practices for documenting data types that while not open or recommended, are very established in the academic fields surrounding Natural Hazards research such as Matlab and Microsoft Excel.

    Should this be a nested list, a table, sub-headings and lists? Is it supposed to be [the user guide dictionaries](/user-guide/dictionary/)?
