        <li>Prepare your OpenSees input file interactively, submit it to HPC, and post-process the results within a single <b>Jupyter Notebook</b>.</li>
        <li>Jupyter Notebooks as well as interactive consoles are available for many interpretive languages: <b>Python, Matlab, Julia, and R</b>.</li>
        <li>There are two Jupyter Hub services: one that runs on a shared VM, and one that runs in the HPC system, thus requiring an HPC allocation.</li>
        <li>You can publish your notebooks in DesignSafe for public access.</li>
        <li>Jupyter Hub is a shared resource -- it is implemented in a unique node in DesignSafe</li>
