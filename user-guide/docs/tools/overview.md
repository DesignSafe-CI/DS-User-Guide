# Requesting New Applications

DesignSafe regularly adds new software applications in support of natural hazards engineering research. You may contact DesignSafe by <a href="/help/new-ticket/">submitting a help ticket</a> if you would like to request the addition of a software application to the Workspace.

The DesignSafe infrastructure includes support for commercial/licensed software. While in some cases licenses can be provided by the DesignSafe project itself, not all vendors will make licenses available for larger open communities at reasonable cost. You may contact DesignSafe by <a href="/help/new-ticket/">submitting a help ticket</a> if you have questions regarding a commercial software application.
