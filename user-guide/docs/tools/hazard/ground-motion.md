## SCEC BBP Ground Motion Portal User Guide { #scec }

The SCEC Broadband Platform is a software system that can generate 0-100 Hz seismograms for historical and scenario earthquakes in California, Eastern North America, and Japan using several alternative computational methods. The SCEC Broadband Platform is a collaborative software development project involving SCEC researchers, research engineers, graduate students, and the SCEC/CME software development group. SCEC scientific groups have contributed modules to the Broadband Platform including rupture generation, low- and high-frequency seismogram synthesis, non-linear site effects, and visualization. These complex scientific codes have been integrated into a system that supports easy on-demand computation of broadband seismograms. The SCEC Broadband Platform is designed to be used by both scientific and engineering researchers with some experience interpreting ground motion simulations.
