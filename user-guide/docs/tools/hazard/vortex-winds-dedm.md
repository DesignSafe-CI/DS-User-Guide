## VORTEX-Winds: DEDM-HR { #vortex }

The NatHaz Modeling Laboratory at the University of Notre Dame serves the Database-Enabled Design Module for High-Rise (DEDM-HR) buildings which seamlessly pools databases of multiple high frequency base balance measurements through wind tunnel tests/experiments from geographically dispersed locations and merges them together to expand the number of available building configurations for preliminary design under winds.
