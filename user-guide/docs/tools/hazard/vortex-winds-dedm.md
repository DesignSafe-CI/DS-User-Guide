## VORTEX-Winds: DEDM-HR { #vortex }

This is a link to the Database-Enabled Design Module for High-Rise (DEDM-HR) buildings. Navigate to the web application developed by the NatHaz Modeling Laboratory, Univ. of Notre Dame which seamlessly pools databases of multiple high frequency base balance measurements through wind tunnel tests/experiments from geographically dispersed locations and merges them together to expand the number of available building configurations for preliminary design under winds. <strong><em>Clicking the link will leave DesignSafe and take you to the TPU website.</em></strong>
