## TPU Wind Databases { #tpu }

The School of Architecture & Wind Engineering at Tokyo Polytechnic University (TPU) serves a collection of aerodynamic databases for isolated and non-isolated low-rise and tall buildings from wind tunnel tests:

<b>Aerodynamic Database of High-rise Buildings</b><br>
The objective is to provide structural design engineers with wind tunnel test data of wind loads on high-rise buildings.22 models of high-rise buildings were tested. Contours of statistical values of local wind pressure coefficients, graphs of statistical values of area averaged wind pressure coefficients on the wall surfaces and time series data of point wind pressure coefficients for 394 test cases are shown. These data can be used to calculate local wind pressures,area averaged wind pressure coefficie on wall surfaces, and even wind induced dynamic responses of high-rise buildings.

<b>Wind Pressure Database for High-rise Building with Adjacent Building</b><br>
The objective is to provide structural design engineers with wind tunnel test data of local wind pressures on a high-rise building under interference. The considered experimental model comprised two buildings: the pressure model, referred to as the principal building, and the other model, referred to as the interfering building. Five types of interfering buildings were considered, all with the same cross section as the principal building but with different heights. All interfering buildings were orientated with their on-face normal to the principal building and were placed at 37 different upstream configurations with respect to the principal building. A total of 72 wind directions were considered, from 0 degree to 355 degree in 5 degree steps. 8640 experimental cases of building arrangements and wind directions were tested. The aerodynamic database based on the results of the present study will help practical designers in preliminary design of building claddings and will be useful in accurately estimating cladding loads on tall buildings due to interference. The aerodynamic database can be provided by mean, rms and peak pressure coefficients on wall surfaces and time series data of point wind pressure coefficients.

<b>Aerodynamic Database of Low-rise Buildings without Eaves</b><br>
The objective is to provide structural design engineers with wind tunnel test data of wind loads on low-rise buildings. 116 models of gable-, hop- and flat-roofed low-rise buildings were tested. 4,176 contours of statistical values of local wind pressure coefficients, 700 graphs of statistical values of area averaged wind pressure coefficients on the roof or wall surfaces and time series data of point wind pressure coefficients for 812 test cases are shown. These data can be used to calculate local wind pressures, area averaged wind pressure coefficient on roof or wall surfaces, and even wind induced dynamic responses of low-rise buildings.

<b>Aerodynamic Database of Gable-roof Low-rise Buildings with Varied Eaves</b><br>
To study the effects of varied eaves on wind loads on gable-roofed low-rise buildings, a series of wind pressure measurement wind tunnel tests were taken for gabled-roof buildings with slope of 26.7* with 3 kinds of eaves (Type A, B, C), eave height of models varied in 60, 120, 180cm. 12 test cases are included in the database from which the local wind pressures, area averaged wind pressure coefficients and wind pressure coefficient time series on roof or wall surfaces and some more detailed information can be queried.

<b>Aerodynamic Database of Non-isolated Low-rise Buildings</b><br>
A series of pressure measurement wind tunnel tests were taken for 3 types of low-rise buildings (flat roof, gable roof and hipped models) surrounded by similar low-rise buildings. Its objective is to investigate the interference effect of regular, staggered, random, with 8 different area density CA (0.1, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.40, 0.50, 0.60) and the heights of target building and surrounding building models are all varied in 60, 120, 180cm. 111 test cases are included in the database from which the local wind pressures, area averaged wind pressure coefficients and wind pressure coefficient time series on roof or wall surfaces and some more detailed information can be queried.
