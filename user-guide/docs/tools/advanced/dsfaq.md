## [MATLAB](#faq-matlab) { #faq-matlab }

<b><a href="/rw/workspace/">www.designsafe-ci.org/rw/workspace</a></b>

<strong>Q: Do I need to provide my own license to run MATLAB?</strong><br>
A: No, you don’t need to provide your own license to run MATLAB in the Discovery Workspace. Our license with MathWorks allows for academic use and you can be from any academic institution. We have a process whereby you request access to MATLAB and we then verify you are an academic user prior to adding you to the license. Simply click on MATLAB in the Discovery Workspace to start the process of requesting access.

<strong>Q: Who can use MATLAB on DesignSafe?</strong><br>
A: Our license with MathWorks allows for academic use and you can be from any academic institution. We have a process whereby you request access to MATLAB and we then verify you are an academic user prior to adding you to the license. Simply click on MATLAB in the Discovery Workspace to start the process of requesting access.

<strong>Q: Why won’t my MATLAB job start and it gets stuck at Staging Inputs?</strong><br>
A: If you are starting up with a folder that has a large number of files and/or a significant number of MB’s, the startup may take too long and time out. Try opening MATLAB with an empty or smaller folder and then once in MATLAB you can switch directories.

<strong>Q: Where did my MATLAB job output go?</strong><br>
A: If you do not specify a location, the default output is shown in the grayed-out text in the Job Output Archive Location field in the job submission form, which is your My Data/Archive/Jobs/YYYY-MO-DD/JobName folder.
