## [Data Depot](#faq-datadepot) { #faq-datadepot }

<strong>Q: What data can I upload to the Data Depot?</strong><br>
A: There are no restrictions on file types for the data that you upload to the Data Depot. We do have special handling procedures for <a href="https://www.designsafe-ci.org/user-guide/curating/#protectedddr" target="_blank">Managing Protected Data</a> such as regulated/secure/PHI/PII/IRB/human-subjects data, so do not upload these data types directly into the Data Depot. All other types of data that you need to perform your research is welcomed and encouraged! 


<strong>Q: How can I transfer data to/from my computer and the Data Depot?</strong><br>
A: Explore the <a href="https://www.designsafe-ci.org/user-guide/managingdata/#data-transfer-guides" target="_blank">Data Transfer Guides</a> to see our recommended methods based on the amount of data you are transferring. 

<strong>Q: What is My Projects?</strong><br>
A: <a href="/data/browser/projects/" target="_blank">My Projects</a> is a place where you can curate and publish data with other collaborators. Data models are integrated to help you easily curate your data. You do not need to be the PI to create a project, so Experimental Facilities can create projects for their users.

<strong>Q: Can I easily copy data from my Cloud Data Provider (Dropbox, Box, etc)?</strong><br>
A: Explore the <a href="https://www.designsafe-ci.org/user-guide/managingdata/#cloud" target="_blank">Cloud Storage Transfer</a> user guide to see which providers we currently connect with for direct data transfer.

<strong>Q: How do I add Designsafe's Box app to my company's/university's whitelist?</strong><br>
A: This will require contacting your IT department to make sure your company/university is using a whitelist for Box apps. If they are, give them Designsafe's client id: <i>gh3tntr70zh1lxf3po7y893rkje696zp</i>.

<strong>Q: Where can I find the NEES Public Data that was available in the NEEShub?</strong><br>
A: The Published directory in the Data Depot holds the <a href="https://www.designsafe-ci.org/data/browser/public-legacy/" target="_blank">NEES Public Data</a>. Projects published using DesignSafe will be hosted there as well. The DOIs for the NEES Public Data point to the Data Depot.

## [Tools & Applications](#faq-workspace) { #faq-workspace }

<strong>Q: I don't see the application I need in the Tools & Applications. How can I use my application?</strong><br>
A: There are a couple of different approaches that can be taken. If this is an open source application that is used by many researchers throughout this research community, then we can work with you to determine if it is a candidate to be added to the Tools & Applications in the portal. <a href="https://www.designsafe-ci.org/help/submit-ticket/" target="_blank">Please submit a ticket</a> to start the conversation. Another approach is that you could <a href="https://www.designsafe-ci.org/user-guide/tools/advanced/hpcallocations" target="_blank">request an allocation</a> on one of TACC's HPC resources, and then you would log directly into the HPC system to run your application. 

<hr>
## [MATLAB](#faq-matlab) { #faq-matlab }

<strong>Q: Do I need to provide my own license to run MATLAB?</strong><br>
A: No, you don’t need to provide your own license to run MATLAB in the Discovery Workspace. Our license with MathWorks allows for academic use and you can be from any academic institution. We have a process whereby you request access to MATLAB and we then verify you are an academic user prior to adding you to the license. Simply click on MATLAB in the Discovery Workspace to start the process of requesting access.

<strong>Q: Who can use MATLAB on DesignSafe?</strong><br>
A: Our license with MathWorks allows for academic use and you can be from any academic institution. We have a process whereby you request access to MATLAB and we then verify you are an academic user prior to adding you to the license. Simply click on MATLAB in the Discovery Workspace to start the process of requesting access.

<strong>Q: Why won’t my MATLAB job start and it gets stuck at Staging Inputs?</strong><br>
A: If you are starting up with a folder that has a large number of files and/or a significant number of MB’s, the startup may take too long and time out. Try opening MATLAB with an empty or smaller folder and then once in MATLAB you can switch directories.

<strong>Q: Where did my MATLAB job output go?</strong><br>
A: If you do not specify a location, the default output is shown in the grayed-out text in the Job Output Archive Location field in the job submission form, which is your My Data/Archive/Jobs/YYYY-MO-DD/JobName folder.

<hr>
## [Jupyter](#faq-jupyter) { #faq-jupyter }

<strong>Q: What is Jupyter?</strong><br>
A: The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. A more detailed description including a list of more than 40 supported programming languages can be found on the <a href="http://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter website</a>.

<strong>Q: What do people do with Jupyter?</strong><br>
A: Many people use Jupyter in a similar fashion as they use MATLAB to analyze and plot their data. We will be sharing example Jupyter Notebooks soon that you can copy into your My Data and customize for your research. We also provide <a href="../../../tools/jupyterhub/#jupyterhub-guide">Jupyter training</a>.
