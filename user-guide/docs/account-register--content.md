Any natural hazards researcher or practitioner that wants an environment to store, analyze, curate, publish, and discover data with a community of peers may register for an account. A DesignSafe account is a University of Texas, Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) user account, so you will sometimes see emails from TACC and URLs that take you to the TACC domain `tacc.utexas.edu`. [TACC offers detailed account registration instructions.](https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/basics/accounts/)

1. [**Request a user account.**](https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/register/)
2. You will be redirected to the TACC account registration page.
3. On the account registration form **we highly recommend** you use the email address provided by your Institution or Company.
4. Set up [multi-factor authentication](https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/basics/mfa/) for your account.
5. Check for an email containing a confirmation and activation link. Once you confirm your email, your account status will update to either "Pending" or "Active".
    1. It's possible that your email provider will either block or mark as spam/junk an email TACC sends with a link to confirm your email address after you submit the registration form. If so, send email to helpATdesignsafe-ci.org letting us know you did not receive the email.
6.  If your account status is "Pending" then your account request will need further review by our User Services team. No action is required and a team member will reach out to you.
7. Once your account status is "Active", you will then be able to [**log in to DesignSafe**](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/login/).
