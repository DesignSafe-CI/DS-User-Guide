# DesignSafe Data Depot

In the Data Depot users can browse, upload, download, share, curate and publish data. It hosts both private and published data associated with a research project and can be used as a working area for any of the users’ own data and work in progress, as well as for curating and publishing datasets. Scientific applications in [Tools &  Applications] (https://www.designsafe-ci.org/use-designsafe/tools-applications/) can access files in the Data Depot, enabling data analysis directly in the DesignSafe portal that minimizes the need to transfer data to your laptop. In turn, users can curate  the data and publish it in the [Data Depot Repository](https://designsafe-ci.org/data/browser/public/designsafe.storage.published)  The Data Depot has the following services listed at the right hand side of the interface:

* **My Data**: Private directory for your data.
* **HPC Work**: Work directory on TACC HPC machines for use with Jupyter.
* **My Projects**: Data to be curated and published must be in this directory. Users can control access and share this data with other team members with whom they are working on a project.
* **Box.com**: Access Box for copying files to DesignSafe.
* **Dropbox.com**: Access Dropbox for copying files to DesignSafe.
* **Published**: Curated datasets with DOI's preserved and made available in the Data Depot Repository.
* **Published (NEES)**: Curated and published datasets supported through the NEES program that ran from 1999 to 2015.
* **Community Data**: Non-curated user-contributed data.
