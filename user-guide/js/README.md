# DesignSafe User Guide Scripts

1. Create your JavaScript in appropriate folder, or `inbox.module.js` if unsure.
2. For each file you add, `import` it in `import.css`.

Scripts specific to DS-User-Guide should be in this directory.

Scripts for all TACC-themed docs belong in https://github.com/TACC/mkdocs-tacc.
