2. Install dependencies:\
    <sup>You should only need to do this once.</sup>
    ```shell

    poetry install
    ```
4. Serve the docs:
    ```shell
    poetry shell
    cd user-guide
    mkdocs serve
    ```
    <sup>After the `poetry shell` command, you should be in a Poetry-managed environment. Your prompt might be prefixed with the name of the environment.</sup>

## Releases

All commits to `main` will trigger a docker build and push a new image to `designsafeci/ds-user-guide:latest`.

A Watchtower service will monitor new pushes to this dockerhub repo and pull down new images on the fly to https://designsafeci-dev.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guide/
