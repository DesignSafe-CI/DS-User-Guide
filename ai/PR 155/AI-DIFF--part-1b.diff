-**Q: What are the best file formats for data publications?**  
-**A**: For long-term preservation purposes it is best to publish data in interoperable and open formats. For example, instead of Excel spreadsheet files -which are proprietary- it is best to convert them to CSV for publication. And, instead of Matlab files -also proprietary- it is best to publish data as simple txt (ascii) so it can be used by many different software. However, be aware that conversion may distort the data structure, so retain an original copy of any structured data (e.g. Matlab, Excel files) before attempting conversions and then check between the two for fidelity. In addition, you may publish both the proprietary and the open format, and/or consult the Data Curation Primers to find out how to better curate research data.

-**Q: What does DesignSafe recommend for zip files?**  
-**A**: If you uploaded your data as zip files, you should unzip before publishing. Zip files prevent others from directly viewing and understanding your data in the cloud. You may upload zip files to your "MyData" and unzip them using the [Extract utility](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/workspace/extract) before copying them to your project.
+/// details | What are the best file formats for data publications?
 
-**Q: My project has many individual files. It will be cumbersome for a user to download them one by one. What do you suggest?**  
-**A**: Through the web interface, downloading a lot of individual files is cumbersome. However, DesignSafe offers a number of solutions for this issue. First, users may interact with data in the cloud, without the need to download, using Matlab scripts as well as Jupyter notebooks. In this case, users may find downloading large quantities of data to be unnecessary. If users want to download a large number of files from a project, we recommend that they use Globus or include zip files for your data files. However, if you include zip files you should include the unzipped files in your project as well. If you wish to make your data easy to download, it is best to aggregate small individual files into a smaller number of larger files when feasible.

-**Q: Should I publish raw data?**  
-**A**: Raw data is that which comes directly from the recording instruments (camera, apps, sensors, scanners, etc.). When raw data is corrected, calibrated, reviewed, edited, or post-processed in any way for publication, it is called curated. Some researchers want to publish their raw data as well as their curated data; if this is your case, consider why it is necessary to publish both sets, and how another researcher would use it. Always clarify whether your data is raw or curated in the description or in a readme file, and use applicable methods to review the data for errors before publishing.

-**Q: I will publish a large collection of images. What do I need to consider?**  
-**A**: Be selective with the images you choose to publish. Make sure they have a purpose and are illustrative of a process or a function. Use file tags to describe them. If the images include team members make sure they are comfortable with making their images public. If images include people that have been affected by the natural hazard, you should procure their authorization to make their pictures public.

-**Q: What type of Data projects can be published in DesignSafe?**  
-**A**: We have multiple data models and you may publish project types as "Experimental", "Simulation", "Hybrid Simulation", "Field Research" and "Other". Using the "Field Research" data model, you can publish both Engineering/Geosciences collections as well as Social Sciences collections. Stand-alone reports, presentations, software and white papers, as well as datasets that do not fit with the rest of the project types can be published in the project type "Other".

-**Q: How should I select data to be published in a project?**    
-**A**: While right now there is no limit to the amount of files that can be published in DesignSafe, the comprehension and reuse potential of the data should be important considerations when selecting what data can be published. This goes with the possibility to clearly describe the data and establish and document its completeness and validity. For all project types, you have the option to select a subset of the files uploaded to My Project that you wish to publish without the need to delete them from the Working Directory.

-### Organizing & Describing Your Dataset { #organizing }
+Raw data is that which comes directly from the recording instruments (camera, apps, sensors, scanners, etc.). When raw data is corrected, calibrated, reviewed, edited, or post-processed in any way for publication, it is called curated. Some researchers want to publish their raw data as well as their curated data; if this is your case, consider why it is necessary to publish both sets, and how another researcher would use it. Always clarify whether your data is raw or curated in the description or in a readme file, and use applicable methods to review the data for errors before publishing.
 
-**Q: How should I organize the data files to be published in a project?**
-**A**: For each type of project publication, the best way to organize your data is to map them to the organizational schema provided by the data models available for each research type (simulation, experimental, hybrid simulation and field research). These models were designed by experts and represent the main data and documentation components required for others to understand and reuse your dataset.
+///
+/// details | I will publish a large collection of images. What do I need to consider?
 
-**Q: Can I organize my data files into a hierarchy of folders in DesignSafe?**  
-**A**: DesignSafe offers methods for categorizing (organizing) and tagging (describing) your files. To enhance organization and description of large and complex projects, users can group files in folders. However, it is always best to avoid overly nesting because browsing through an extensive folder hierarchy on the web is slower than on your local computer. So to improve the user experience, you should try to use the smallest number of nested folders necessary. Instead, you may use categories, descriptions, and tags to indicate what the groupings are. This provides a method for users to identify and search your files efficiently.
+Be selective with the images you choose to publish. Make sure they have a purpose and are illustrative of a process or a function. Use file tags to describe them. If the images include team members make sure they are comfortable with making their images public. If images include people that have been affected by the natural hazard, you should procure their authorization to make their pictures public.
 
-**Q: How should I describe the dataset organization in a project type "Other"?**  
-**A**: In project type Other you will be able to tag individual files for ease of data understandability and reuse. If you publish many files and need to organize them in folders, we suggest providing a description of the organizational structure and naming convention that you use in your dataset in a "readme" file or a report. This file can simply be a text file or pdf file.
+///
+/// details | What type of Data projects can be published in DesignSafe?
 
-**Q: Why do you require a report/readme in all of your data publications?**  
-**A**: The "Experimental", "Simulation", "Hybrid Simulation", and "Field Research" project types provide a representation of the structure of the datasets. Still, you may need to clarify the meaning of the fields of your datasets, the functions of your files and their naming convention, the way you decided to organize them, or describe other reuse characteristics of your data. Providing a report/readme file and/or a data dictionary associated with your data is an ideal way to express this information.

-**Q: How can I provide more contextual information about my published dataset?**  
-**A**: To enhance the knowledge surrounding your dataset, you can use the "Related Work" field at the project level to point to web-pages, publications, or datasets that are published within or outside DesignSafe and that you consider relevant to point to in your publication. For example, you may point to a separate published project in DesignSafe, or provide the title and DOI of an article that relates to your data. You may also use the description fields in the data model to include specific parameters or facts that you want to highlight (e.g. wind speed during a hurricane, earthquake magnitude, damage types, etc.). Adding tags, both from a controlled list available or by including a custom one, helps other users to find the files that they need within the data landing page.
+///
+/// details | How should I select data to be published in a project?
 
-**Q: How can I convey the quality of my data publication?**  
-**A**: Data quality, as entailed by the metadata, concerns the completeness of the data documentation and the validity and integrity of the data content. Following DesignSafe curation and documentation best practices, as well as the onboarding instructions on the curation and publication interfaces, and adding a data report or data dictionary enables publishing a complete dataset that others will understand. In addition, in the documentation and/or data description, it is important to clarify the processes conducted to assure the completeness and validity of the data content.

-**Q: I have another published work that is related to the project I am now planning to publish. How can I relate them?**  
-**A**: On the project landing page under Edit Project there is a "Related Work" field where you have the option to include one or more associated projects and publications to your current project. Here, you can provide the title as well as a link to that project or publication. This link can be a DOI or a URL for any content found inside or outside of DesignSafe. For DOIs, please make sure you are adding the entire DOI address starting with "http" to correctly link the webpage to the related project.

-**Q: Which license is appropriate for my publication?**  
-**A**: Licenses indicate the conditions in which you, as a data creator, want the data to be used by others. Due to the variety of resources published in DesignSafe, we provide four different types of open licenses. These cover datasets, software, materials with intellectual property rights, and the different ways in which you want your work to be attributed.

-**Q: What is a DOI?**  
-**A**: A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a unique alphanumeric string assigned by a registration agency (the International DOI Foundation) to identify a resource and provide a persistent link to its location on the Internet. You can find a registered resource by its DOI using the "Resolve a DOI Name" function at: [http://www.doi.org/](http://www.doi.org/){target="_blank"}. In addition, you may find the citation information for that DOI in DataCite at [https://search.datacite.org/](https://search.datacite.org/){target="_blank"}.
+## Organizing & Describing Your Dataset { #organizing }
 
-**Q: What is the relation between a DOI and a data citation?**  
-**A**: The DOI is a component of a citation for a work that is stored online. Therefore, it provides access to the permanent URL and the cited resource.
+/// details | How should I organize the data files to be published in a project?
 
-**Q: I have multiple experiments/simulations/missions to publish under one project. How should I do it?**  
-**A**: Projects with multiple experiments/simulations/missions (publication units) can be published sequentially over a large period of time. After one publication unit is completed, you may resume uploading files and will be able to publish another unit within the same project.  Each may have different authors and will receive individual DOIs.

-**Q: If the project type is "Experimental"/ "Simulation"/ "Field Research", how can I assign relevant authors to each experiment/simulation/mission?**  
-**A**: While creating experiments/simulations/missions, you have the option to assign authors to each one. Additionally, after successfully creating the publication, you can click on "Add (Experiment/Simulation/Mission)" on the Curation Directory page and then edit the authors and their order within the corresponding experiment/simulation/mission found in the inventory list.
+///

-### Data Reuse { #datareuse }
+///
 
-**Q: How can I contribute to the reuse of data?**  
-**A**: Datasets take a lot of work to produce; they are important research products. By creating a complete, clean, and clearly described data publication you are already inviting others to use and cite your data. Always cite your datasets and those of others that you have reused in the reference section of your papers using the citation language and DOI provided on DesignSafe, and encourage your peers and students to do the same. If you use social media or a presentation platform to talk about your research, always include the proper citation and DOI on your materials (ppts, abstracts, emails, etc.). Note that a researcher does not actually need to reuse a dataset to cite it, but rather may cite a dataset to reference something of note in the dataset (e.g., how it was collected, its uniqueness, etc.). This is similar to the process of citing other papers.

+# Data Dissemination and Impact
 
-### Data Metrics { #data }
+Data metrics indicate research impact, allowing researchers to assess the repercussions and influence of their work. Citation and usage metrics are included, and are visible on the landing page of each dataset publication. 
 
-Data metrics are research impact indicators complementary to other forms of evaluation such as number of paper citations, allowing researchers to assess the repercussions and influence of their work.
+Except for projects categorized as “Other,” a project can encompass more than one dataset publication in the Data Depot Repository (DDR). Different creators may produce projects at different times, and have different DOIs. We report metrics per published dataset with a DOI. 
 
-Metrics available in DesignSafe follow the Make your Data Count  <a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/code-practice-research-data/" target="_blank">Counter Code of Practice for Research Data.</a> This is a community standard to count data usage transparently and in a normalized way. For more information about this approach please visit <a href="https://makedatacount.org/data-metrics-2/" target="_blank">Make your Data Count Metrics</a>.
+## Data Usage Metrics
 
-In Natural Hazards, a research project can encompass more than one data publication which can be produced at different times by different creators and have different DOIs. In DesignSafe, project types are: Other, Experimental, Simulation, Hybrid Simulation, and Field Research. In turn, each has different data publications. Project type "Other" only has one data publication and DOI, while the rest may have more than one data publication and therefore multiple DOIs per project.
+Usage metrics published in the DDR follow the Make Data Count (MDC) [Counter Code of Practice for Research Data](https://www.projectcounter.org/code-practice-research-data/). This is a community standard to count data usage transparently and in a normalized way. (For more information about this approach please visit [Make Data Count Metrics](https://makedatacount.org/learn-about-us/#section-1).) Towards normalization, a session is an important concept to understand.
 
-<strong>Data Publications:</strong>
+Session: All data usage activity during one clock hour from a single IP address and user-agent (a string that identifies the user's browser and operating system.). This is used as a proxy for distinct users to count unique requests and unique investigations.
 
-Experiment (in Experimental projects)
+Descriptions of each usage metric reported by DDR are below.
 
-Mission and Document collection (in Field Research projects)
+- **File Preview**: Examining data from an individual data publication (clicking on a file name, for example) brings up a modal window that previews the files. Those file previews are counted. However, not all document types can be previewed. Text files, spreadsheets, graphics, and code files can be previewed (e.g. .txt, .doc, .docx, .csv, .xlsx, .pdf, .jpg, .m, .ipynb). Binary executables, MATLAB containers, compressed files, and video files cannot be previewed (eg. .bin, .mat, .zip, .tar, mp4, .mov). Only previewable files are counted. Users will see a count of all the files that have been previewed in the data publication.
+- **File Download**: Copying a file to the user’s machine, or to a storage device that the machine has access to. This can be done by ticking the checkbox next to a file and selecting "Download" at the top of the project page. With files that can be previewed, clicking "Download" at the top of the preview modal window has the same effect. Downloads are counted on an individual file basis. We also consider counts when users tick the checkbox next to a file and select "Copy" at the top of the project page. The counts of copying a file from the published project can be to the user's My Data or My Projects to Tools and Applications in the Workspace, or to one of the connected spaces (Box, Dropbox, Google Drive).
+- **Total Requests**: Total file downloads + total file previews. This is counted for each data publication that has a DOI (eg. Simulation, Experiment, Mission, Hybrid simulation , Documents Collection and Project Type Other).
+- **Unique Requests**{#unique-requests}: Sessions in which one or more files are downloaded or previewed. Any downloads, previews, copies of files, or project downloads from a single data publication (DOI) by a user in a single session counts as one Unique Request. This is counted for each data publication with a single DOI including Simulations, Hybrid Simulations, Experiments, Missions, Documents Collection and Project Type Other. 
+- **Unique Investigations**{#unique-investigations}: Sessions in which any project or publications metadata is viewed, or one or more files is downloaded or previewed. Any viewing of metadata as well as any downloads, previews, copies of files, or project downloads from a single data publication (DOI) by a user in a single session counts as one Unique Investigation. This is counted for each data publication with a single DOI including Simulations, Hybrid Simulations, Experiments, Missions, Documents Collection and type Other projects.
 
-Simulation (in Simulation projects)
+Usage metrics are displayed in the citation modal underneath “Download Citation” as “Unique Requests” and “Unique Investigations.” Clicking on “Details” to the right enables a modal window that displays the metrics, including their definitions, in aggregates and per quarter for researchers to assess impact over time. 
 
-Hybrid Simulation (in Hybrid Simulation projects)
+Usage metrics date back to January 2022 and are updated monthly.
 
-Other-type project (these encompass only one data publication and thus one level of metrics).
+## Interpreting Data Metrics
 
-Because of the structure of the research projects in DesignSafe we report metrics at the project and at the data publication levels. Metrics at the project level allow researchers to assess the overall impact of the projects because it aggregates the usage of all the data publications. Instead, data publication metrics provide granular information about the usage of each publication that has a DOI within a project.
+Dataset citations and usage are complementary metrics. The former account for the creation, reference to, or reuse of datasets as demonstrated in a publication. Similarly to web page hits and downloads of resources, the latter represents the attention to particular resources on the web. We aggregate and inform users of citations and datasets on a quarterly basis on the [DesignSafe Impact](https://designsafe-ci.org/use-designsafe/impact/) page. Both aggregated and individual metrics can be considered as they evolve over time and in context with similar data types, hazard types, and discipline. 
 
-Data Metrics is a work in progress and we add measurements on an ongoing basis. We started counting Project Metrics in March 2021 And Data Publication Metrics in January 2022.
+## Citation Metrics
 
-Below are descriptions of each type of metric and what is counted at the project and at the data publication levels.
+Dataset citations are references to a dataset in published materials including journal papers, books and chapters, conference proceedings, and thesis and dissertations. Citation counts per a dataset's DOI varies depending on the source providing the information. The DDR uses the Data [Citation Index from Clarivate](https://clarivate.com/academia-government/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-referencing/web-of-science/data-citation-index/) as a source of citations. Clarivate only harvests citations from the reference section of peer-reviewed publications. Google Scholar, on the other hand, harvests citations and mentions from any part of a publication available via the Web. This includes presentations, bulletins, and reports, making it too difficult to automate the count of precise citations.
 
-### Project Metrics { #project }
+Two types of citations are counted: platform citations and dataset citations. 
 
-<strong>File Preview: </strong>Examining data in any data publication within a project such as clicking on a file name brings up a modal window that allows previewing the files. However, not all data types can be previewed. Among those that can are: text, spreadsheets, graphics and code files. (example extensions: .txt, .doc, .docx, .csv, .xlsx, .pdf, .jpg, .m, .ipynb). Those that can't include binary executables, MATLAB containers, compressed files, and video (eg. .bin, .mat, .zip, .tar, mp4, .mov). Only those files that can be previewed are counted. Users will get a count of all the files that have been previewed in the entire project.
+Platform citations are citations to marker papers written about DesignSafe such as:
 
-<strong>File Download: </strong>Copying a file to the machine the user is running on, or to a storage device that the machine has access to. This can be done by ticking the checkbox next to a file and selecting "Download" at the top of the project page. With files that can be previewed, clicking "Download" at the top of the preview modal window has the same effect. Downloads are counted per project. We also consider counts when users tick the checkbox next to a document and select "Copy" at the top of the project page. The counts of copying a file from the published project can be to the user's My data, My projects, to Tools and Applications in the Workspace, or to one of the connected spaces (Box, Dropbox, Google Drive). Users will get a count of all the files that have been downloaded in the entire project.

Padgett, J.E., Pinelli, J.-P., Stanzione, D., Adair, A., Arduino, P., Brandenberg, S.J., Cockerill, T., Dey, C., Esteva, M., Haan, Jr., F.L., Hanlon, M., Kareem, A., Lowes, L., Mock, S., and Mosqueda, G. 2017. “DesignSafe: A New Cyberinfrastructure for Natural Hazards Engineering,” ASCE Natural Hazards Review, doi:10.1061/(ASCE)NH.1527-6996.0000246.
 
-<strong>File Requests: </strong>Total file downloads + total file previews. This is counted and aggregated for all data publications that have a DOI within a project (eg. Simulation, Experiment, Mission, Hybrid simulation and Documents Collection). Users will get a count of all the files that have been requested in the entire project.
+Dataset citation counts appear in the citation modal beneath the Download Citation links. They include citations to original or reused datasets, reports, survey instruments, poster presentations, and meeting proceedings published in the DDR.
 
-<strong>Total Investigations: </strong>File requests + metadata views. Viewing the main project information / metadata in the landing page counts as an investigation of each DOI included in the project. Opening a data publication (eg. simulation, experiment, documents collection, mission, hybrid simulation) counts as one investigation of that specific data publication.Requests and metadata views at the data publication level are counted and aggregated at the project level metrics.

-<strong>Project Downloads: </strong>Total downloads of a compressed entire project and its metadata to a user's machine.
+Original citations are from papers in which a researcher cites their own data in the DDR as a part of the original research project, and data reuse is a citation to datasets available in DesignSafe after the original project is over. 
 
-### Data Publication Metrics { #publication }
+Citations are updated through the last month of the prior quarter. 
 
-<strong>File Preview:</strong> Examining data from an individual data publication such as clicking on a file name brings up a modal window that allows previewing files. Those file previews are counted. However, not all document types can be previewed. Among those that can are: text, spreadsheets, graphics and code files. (example extensions: .txt, .doc, .docx, .csv, .xlsx, .pdf, .jpg, .m, .ipynb). Those that can't include binary executables, MATLAB containers, compressed files, and video (eg. .bin, .mat, .zip, .tar, mp4, .mov).  Only those files that can be previewed are counted. Users will get a count of all the files that have been previewed in the data publication.
+## Marketing Datasets
 
-<strong>File Download: </strong>Copying a file to the machine the user is running on, or to a storage device that the machine has access to. This can be done by ticking the checkbox next to a file and selecting "Download" at the top of the project page. With files that can be previewed, clicking "Download" at the top of the preview modal window has the same effect. Downloads are counted per individual files. We also consider counts when users tick the checkbox next to a file and select "Copy" at the top of the project page. The counts of copying a file from the published project can be to the user's My data, My projects, to Tools and Applications in the Workspace, or to one of the connected spaces (Box, Dropbox, Google Drive).
-
-<strong>File Requests: </strong>Total file downloads + total file previews. This is counted for each data publication that has a DOI (eg. Simulation, Experiment, Mission, Hybrid simulation and Documents Collection).
-
-<strong>Session: </strong>All activity during one clock hour from a single IP address and user-agent (a string that identifies the user's browser and operating system.).  This is used as a proxy to define a session to count unique requests and unique investigations.
-
-<strong>Unique Requests: </strong>Any downloads, previews, copies of files, or project downloads from a single data publication (DOI) by a user in a single session counts as 1 Unique Request. This is counted for each data publication with a single DOI including Simulations, Hybrid Simulations, Experiments, Missions, Documents Collection and type Other projects.
-
-<strong>Total Investigations: </strong>File requests + metadata views. Reading the metadata (information about the project and or the data publication) on the landing page counts as an investigation of each data publication with a DOI included in a project. Opening a data publication counts as one investigation of that data publication.
-
-<strong>Unique Investigations: </strong>Any viewing of metadata and any downloads, previews, copies of files or project downloads from a single data publication (DOI) by a user in a single session counts as 1 Unique Investigation. This is counted for each data publication with a single DOI including Simulations, Hybrid Simulations, Experiments, Missions, Documents Collection and type Other projects.
+Datasets take a lot of work to produce; they are important research products. By creating a complete, organized, and clearly described publication in DDR, users are inviting others to reuse and cite their data. Researchers using published data from DDR must cite it using the DOI, which relies on the [DataCite schema](http://schema.datacite.org/) for accurate citation. For convenience, users can retrieve a formatted citation from the published data landing page. It is recommended to insert the citations in the reference section of the paper to facilitate citation tracking and count.
 
+When using social media or any presentation platform to communicate research, it is important to include the proper citation and DOI on the presentations, emails, tweets, professional blog posts, etc.. A researcher does not actually need to reuse a dataset to cite it, but rather may cite it to point/review something about a dataset (e.g., how it was collected, its uniqueness, certain facts, etc.). This is similar to the process of citing other papers within a literary review section.
