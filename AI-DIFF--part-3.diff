 ## Mission
-The mission of the Data Depot Repository (DDR) is to provide data producers with an open repository to safely store, share, and curate natural hazards research data, ensuring its permanent publication, distribution, and impact evaluation. DDR enables users to discover, search, access, and reuse data, thereby accelerating research discoveries. DDR is a component of the DesignSafe cyberinfrastructure which represents a comprehensive open science research environment that provides cloud-based tools to manage, analyze, understand, and publish critical data to understand the impacts of natural hazards. DesignSafe is part of the NSF-supported [Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI)](https://designsafe-ci.org/about/), and aligns with its mission to provide the  natural hazards research community with open access, shared resources aimed at supporting civil and social infrastructures prior to, during, and following natural disasters.

+The Data Depot Repository (DDR) is one component of the DesignSafe cyberinfrastructure, which represents a comprehensive research environment that provides cloud-based tools to manage, analyze, understand, and publish critical data for research to understand the impacts of natural hazards. DDR is the platform for curation and publication of datasets generated in the course of natural hazards research. It is an open access repository that enables data producers to safely store, share, organize, and describe research data, and assigns Digital Object Identifiers towards permanent publication and distribution of datasets. The DDR allows data consumers to discover, search for, access, and reuse published data to accelerate research discovery. DDR monitors datasets usage and citations over time to communicate their impact.  DesignSafe is part of the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI), and aligns with its mission to provide the natural hazards research community with open access, shared-use scholarship, education, and community resources aimed at supporting civil infrastructure prior to, during, and following natural disasters. DesignSafe also supports the broader natural hazards research community that extends beyond the NHERI network.

 ## History
-Founded in 2016, the DDR was established as an [open-access](https://www.openaccess.nl/en/what-is-open-access) data repository. Supported by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/), it preserves and provides access to natural hazards research data including [legacy datasets](https://designsafe-ci.org/data/browser/public/nees.public) dating back to 2005 generated under the NSF-supported Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES), the predecessor to NHERI. Since 2022 DDR is a [Core Trust Seal Certified Data Repository](https://www.coretrustseal.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/20230126-designsafe_final.pdf) ensuring the sustainability and trustworthiness of its infrastructure and the data it preserves. The certification is current until 2026.
 
-## Governance 
-DDR governance aims to ensure effective and secure data curation and publication in compliance with relevant regulations and best practices, supporting the discovery, access, preservation and reuse of critical research data. Governance is managed by the DesignSafe management team, which is responsible for setting and updating policies, recommending best practices, overseeing technical development, and prioritizing key activities and services encompassing datasets, systems, and processes associated with the DDR. All activities are driven by the research community of practice operationalized by the NHERI network, and informed by digital library standards. The broad organizational structure under which the DDR operates is shown on [About NHERI DesignSafe](https://designsafe-ci.org/about/designsafe/).
+The DDR has been in operation since 2016 and is currently supported by NSF through 2025. The DDR preserves natural hazards research data published since its inception, and also provides access to legacy data dating from about 2005. These legacy data were generated as part of the NSF-supported Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES), a predecessor to NHERI. Legacy data and metadata belonging to NEES were transferred to the DDR for continuous preservation and access. [View the published NEES data.](https://designsafe-ci.org/data/browser/public/nees.public)
+
+
+## Governance
 
-An Advisory Board provides strategic guidance and feedback on DesignSafe's initiatives and activities. Established with 7 members representing the broader natural hazards community, the board holds bi-annual meetings and helps shape the DDR's direction, ensuring it meets the evolving needs and challenges of the natural hazards community. More information on the board can be found here.
+Policies for the DDR are driven by the Natural Hazards  scientific community and informed by best practices in library and information sciences. The DDR operates under the leadership of the DesignSafe Management Team, which establishes and updates policies, evaluates and recommends best practices, oversees its technical development, and prioritizes activities. The broad organizational structure under which the DDR operates is shown on [About NHERI DesignSafe](https://designsafe-ci.org/about/designsafe/).
 
-Formal mechanisms are in place for external evaluators to gather feedback and conduct structured assessments in the form of usability studies and yearly user surveys. To ensure that the repository is meeting the community’s needs there are different feedback mechanisms for users to provide input and suggest enhancements, and processes in place for evaluation of those requests and implementation of updates. All DDR activities are reported to the National Science Foundation on a quarterly and annual basis in terms of quantitative and qualitative progress.
 
 ## Infrastructure
-DesignSafe including DDR are hosted at the [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://tacc.utexas.edu/)(TACC)at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). TACC provides access to high performance computing, visualization, and large scale data analysis computational resources, as well as to reliable large scale data management and storage solutions. Cloud and portal services further increase the ways in which users can access data and computational resources to advance their work.
 
-## Repository Team 
-An interdisciplinary repository team carries out ongoing design, development, and day-to-day operations of the DDR. The team gathers requirements and discusses solutions through bi-monthly meetings with members of the DesignSafe management team as well as with members of the [NHERI network](https://designsafe-ci.org/about/) to meet the requirements and commitments of their distinct research focus and functions. To track development the DDR curator meets every other week with the DesignSafe PI and with the head of the development team. Based on these fluid communications, the team designs functionalities, researches and develops best-practices, and implements agreed-upon solutions. The figure below shows the current formation of the repository team.

-## Data Transfer
+# Transferring Your Data
 
 DesignSafe supports multiple ways of moving data in and out of the Data Depot, the data transfer method that is best for you will depend on the quantity of data you wish to move. There are two broad categories of data transfer methods available; we will refer to these categories as large data transfer methods and normal data transfer methods. Large data transfer methods are for situations where you want to move a large amount of data (&gt; 2GB), a large numbers of files (&gt; 25), or folders. Whereas normal data transfer methods are for situations where you wish to move a small amount of data (&lt; 2GB) stored across a small number of files (&lt; 25).
 
 This document provides a brief description of the various methods available for moving data to and from DesignSafe to assist you in identifying the right data transfer method for your research needs. Once you have selected your data transfer method, each description concludes with a link to detailed instructions for initiating your transfer.

 Start by authenticating by entering the following:
 
-<code>globus login</code>
+`globus login`
 
 This will prompt you to authenticate through your web-browser and grant permissions to Globus-CLI.

-<code>globus transfer [OPTIONS] SOURCE_ENDPOINT_ID[:SOURCE_PATH] DEST_ENDPOINT_ID[:DEST_PATH]</code>
+`globus transfer [OPTIONS] SOURCE_ENDPOINT_ID[:SOURCE_PATH] DEST_ENDPOINT_ID[:DEST_PATH]`

+`globus transfer --recursive [endpoint uuid for your machine]:[path on your machine] [endpoint uuid for tacc corral3]:[path on tacc corral3 to your My Data or Project]`
 
-Fill out the variables in the example command with the UUIDs and paths and submit the transfer. If you are unsure of the appropriate Corral3 path, please refer to the guide on <a href="#setting-path-to-ds-on-corral">Setting the Path to DesignSafe on Corral</a> for more information.

-## Setting Path to DesignSafe on Corral
+# Setting Path to DesignSafe on Corral
 
 The data stored on DesignSafe resides on the large (40 PB), shared data resource Corral located at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. Importantly, Corral services many different projects, not only DesignSafe, and as such utilizes a complex file structure for organization. The purpose of this documentation is to explain how to navitage this complex file structure to locate the directories pertinent to your data transfer needs on DesignSafe.
 
-There are four main locations for data transfers on DesignSafe: <a href="#mydata">My Data</a>, <a href="#myprojects">My Projects</a>, <a href="#published-nheri">Published</a>, and <a href="#published-nees">Published (NEES)</a>, they are each presented in detail below.
+There are four main locations for data transfers on DesignSafe — [My Data](#mydata), [My Projects](#myprojects), [Published](#published-nheri), [Published (NEES)](#published-nees) — each presented in detail below.
